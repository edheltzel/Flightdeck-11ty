This starter project is an adaptation of the original [Flightdeck](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Jekyll) project that leverages [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its static site generation and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for all compiling and bundling of assets.

There is also a [ParcelJS version](https://github.com/flight-deck/flightdeck-jekyll-parcel), if you're into that.

## Inspiration and Folder Structure ðŸ¤”

Like other version of Flightdeck, [Jekyll](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Jekyll/) and [Hugo](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Hugo), each project's objective is to create consistent workflow and reusability of code from project to project. Which was described by JÃ©rÃ´me CoupÃ©'s article [Structuring Eleventy Projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/). Over-time, this will shift as ideas change but 2022, we are shamelessly borrowing concept, structure, and conventions JÃ©rÃ´me CoupÃ© outlines.

## Installation & Usage

#### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-11ty.git
```

#### Install Dependencies

> You can swap `pnpm` in favor of `yarn` or `npm` - but I would suggest enabling Node's corepack this way you do not need to manage your install a separate package manager for Node and all the `pnpm` commands work out-of-the-box.

Read more about Corepack on Node's documentation site - [Node Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html)
